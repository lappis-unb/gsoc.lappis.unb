<p>Currently, Decidim users may feel overwhelmed by the large number of proposals available. A recommendation algorithm can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facilitate the discovery of proposals that are most relevant to each user.</li>
  <li>Increase user engagement and citizen participation.</li>
  <li>Provide a personalized experience, which in turn can lead to a more active and diverse debate.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project proposes a Ruby on Rails–based recommendation system for Decidim’s proposals module, leveraging users’ voting history to suggest relevant proposals. By integrating seamlessly with Decidim’s existing architecture, the solution ensures minimal performance impact and adheres to established privacy policies. The recommendation algorithm will remain transparent, allowing users to understand the rationale behind suggestions. Finally, collaborating with the Decidim community will guide iterative improvements and refinements following the initial deployment.</p>

<p>This project is considered medium to advanced due to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It requires a solid understanding of Decidim’s architecture and the Rails ecosystem.</li>
  <li>The implementation of efficient and scalable recommendation algorithms is essential.</li>
  <li>Careful integration is needed to maintain both system performance and a seamless user experience.</li>
</ul>
