<p>One critical prerequisite for the Brasil Participativo platform is to ensure universal citizen participation. This presents a significant technopolitical challenge in a country marked by pronounced social and educational disparities, where various segments of the population face obstacles in engaging with virtual environments. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in participatory platforms that enable organizations to engage with their communities effectively. These platforms facilitate two-way communication, allowing organizations to gather feedback, crowdsource ideas, and collaborate with their stakeholders. Building on the success and experience of the Brasil Participativo initiative, we propose to develop a boilerplate that will enable organizations to create their own participatory platforms easily.</p>

<p>The project will focus on creating a basic boilerplate that includes essential features such as user authentication, participatory spaces, user experience. The boilerplate will be designed to be scalable and extensible, allowing organizations to add additional features as needed. By developing a participatory platform boilerplate based on Brasil Participativo, we aim to empower organizations to engage with their communities in a meaningful and impactful way. This project aligns with our commitment to promoting transparency, inclusivity, and democratic participation. Some tasks necessary:
Develop a customizable and easy-to-deploy boilerplate based on the principles and features of Brasil Participativo. Provide organizations with a tool to create participatory platforms tailored to their needs. Promote transparency, engagement, and collaboration between organizations and their stakeholder</p>
