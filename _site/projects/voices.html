<p>One of the most significant barriers to inclusivity on the platform is the limited digital literacy among citizens. To ensure the platform truly captures and represents the people’s voices, this project proposes implementing an integrated voice-to-text and chatbot solution. By enabling participants to create, vote, and engage in polls through conversational interfaces—and integrating with commonly used communication channels such as WhatsApp—we aim to provide a more intuitive, accessible experience for all users. The core of this initiative involves integrating an open-source Portuguese speech-to-text and text-to-speech engine into the Decidim platform, ensuring seamless voice-based interactions and facilitating genuine participation. Additionally, the project will include the development of a proof of concept for a general chatbot that guides users step-by-step through the process of joining and contributing to the platform, further reducing technological barriers and bridging the digital literacy gap. Both solutions are expected to be deployed in the Brasil Participativo Platform.</p>

<p><strong>Expected Deliverables</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Voice-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Integration</strong>: An open-source Portuguese solution fully integrated into the Decidim platform, enabling voice-based creation of proposals and participation in polls.</li>
  <li><strong>Chatbot for Participation</strong>: A user-friendly chatbot capable of both receiving voice inputs and responding with synthesized speech, guiding participants through various platform features.</li>
  <li><strong>Proof of Concept &amp; Documentation</strong>: A working prototype demonstrating the end-to-end functionality of voice-driven participation, accompanied by clear documentation to support further development, scalability, and adoption across Brazil’s public participation initiatives.</li>
</ul>
