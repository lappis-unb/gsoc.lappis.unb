<p>LAPPIS is a Brazilian Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) lab at the University of Brasilia (UnB), led by women, and dedicated to fostering collaboration in free and open-source communities. Our mission is to increase the participation of young South Americans, women, and other underrepresented groups in high-impact open-source projects.</p>

<p>We achieve our mission by collaborating with government agencies and private-sector partners on open-source initiatives. To date, we have awarded over 100 scholarships to students, enabling them to contribute to Brazil’s open-source ecosystem. In addition, LAPPIS advocates for open standards, participates in policy discussions, and raises awareness about the benefits of open-source development and adoption—while helping to strengthen the local industry.</p>

<p>In 2024, we had four exceptional contributors join our community through Google Summer of Code (GSoC), supported by eight dedicated mentors who also gained valuable experience from the program.</p>
