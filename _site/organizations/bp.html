<p>Brasil Participativo is the LARGEST SOCIAL PARTICIPATION PLATFORM OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT of Brazil IN ALL TIMES. The Participative Brazil Platform is the new social participation platform of the federal government, built so that the population can contribute to the creation and improvement of public policies. The platform was developed in open-source software with the support of Dataprev, the Decidim-Brasil community, the Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services (MGI), and the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB), LAPPIS.</p>

<p>A notable initiative on this platform was the Participatory Pluriannual Plan (PPA) in July 2023, which gathered proposals from over 1.4 million active participants. Looking forward, the Brazil Participativo platform, powered by Decidim, enables national councils, ministries, and federal agencies to conduct inclusive public consultations, creating a space for citizens to actively contribute to the formulation of decrees, ordinances, and other critical actions.</p>
