On Brasil Participativo, the current sign-up process collects extensive user data, creating a significant barrier to civic engagement. One proposed solution is the “cone participation methodology,” which allows users to participate in simpler activities (such as polls) through an easy login process, reserving the more in-depth sign-up steps for more complex participation opportunities. This approach maintains the platform’s reliability while also enabling one-click, hassle-free engagement.

To ensure data is collected responsibly, we plan to distribute the data-gathering process across different components, areas, and stages within the system. By collecting information only when it is strictly necessary, we reduce friction for participants and create a more welcoming experience—ultimately fostering greater civic involvement on the platform.

Tasks involving this project:

* Implement changes in Decidim, potentially by creating an external gem
* Implement user interfaces for data collecting
* Implement backend functions to collect and store user data progressively

This project has intermediate complexity. The contributor will have the need to get familiar with the Decidim project structure and its particularities as well as Ruby on Rails.
