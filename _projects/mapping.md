Political digital participation encompasses various methods, ranging from conventional public consultations and polls to more innovative approaches like submitting and voting on proposals. However, one less commonly utilized method is mapping, which allows discussions and participation around geolocalized proposals and issues. In essence, this method enables engagement with local, territorial, and political demands and concerns within a geographical context. Despite being widely adopted in social media and other digital arenas, this feature is notably absent in Decidim.

This project aims to fill this gap by implementing a mapping component in Brasil Participativo. The envisioned functionalities include the ability to upload shape files for additional information, enabling the creation of proposals with geocoding, and visualizing proposals and other relevant layers on a single map. Each participatory space will have its own shapefile that can be viewed in isolation or overlaid with other participatory processes conducted on the platform. The functional requirements of this component have already been outlined, along with the necessary technical documentation to develop a plugin in Ruby on Rails, adhering to the Decidim architecture (plugin architecture).
