One of the major challenges we face is integrating databases from the Brazilian federal government's core systems. Because there is no unique identifier to link these systems, they rely on unstructured fields—such as the “Observation” field—for record matching.

To address this, we plan to build an AI agent capable of processing the “Observation” fields across multiple databases (in portuguese), identifying key identifiers, and storing them in an organized format. We will develop a data pipeline that consumes information from each database, applies tokenization techniques and pattern recognition (using decision trees and RapidFuzzy), and then inserts the extracted identifiers into a structured table. We will also explore the potential of large language models (LLMs), in portuguese,  for this extraction task.

Finally, we will validate our results, refine our methods, and document the entire process. This will ensure accurate identifier extraction, paving the way for smoother system integration in the future. Given that these databases span multiple ministries, this project promises a significant impact, benefiting Brazil’s entire federal administration.
