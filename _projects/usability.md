One critical prerequisite for the Brasil Participativo platform is to ensure universal citizen participation. This presents a significant technopolitical challenge in a country marked by pronounced social and educational disparities, where various segments of the population face obstacles in engaging with virtual environments. The primary objective of this project is to comprehensively assess the platform's usability, language inclusivity, and accessibility. By identifying areas for improvement, the aim is to bridge the gap for traditionally excluded demographics, including those with limited internet access (often restricted to cell phones), minimal technological literacy, and illiteracy.

This project aims to identify possible gaps in the website usability with an extensive report after the assessment. The contributor is expected to evaluate tools for each of the aspects that should be checked (usability, accessibility, performance with low-end mobile devices, performance with unstable internet connection, and language inclusivity), understand relevant metrics and indicators, run checks on the platform and elaborate a document including their findings. The report should also include good examples to be followed and, if possible, suggest changes. This project does not expect nor encourage coding contributions, but they will be welcomed if time permits.
