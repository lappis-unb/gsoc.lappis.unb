We propose building or integrating a robust open-source open data platform—enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities—to ensure data accessibility, usability, and meaningful insights. The solution will include the following components:

**RAG-Enhanced Search & Filtering** - Incorporate RAG-based features for intelligent querying and natural language processing, allowing users to quickly find and interpret datasets.
Provide advanced search filters and intuitive data discovery workflows that leverage RAG to summarize or clarify the content of large datasets.
**User Feedback & Contributions** - Enable citizens to offer feedback, suggest improvements, and contribute data insights, fostering a participatory approach to governance. Integrate RAG-driven suggestions and interactive prompts to guide users in refining their searches, understanding dataset contexts, and contributing meaningful feedback.
**Open-Source Tool Integration** - Research and implement a proven open data management tool (e.g., CKAN) as the platform’s backbone. Extend the tool with RAG components (such as custom plugins or APIs) to provide natural language summaries and context-relevant insights extracted from the datasets.
**Impact** -By combining open data principles with cutting-edge RAG technology, this initiative will provide a more intuitive, transparent way for citizens and stakeholders to interact with and comprehend government data. Not only will it simplify the discovery and usage of public datasets, but it will also empower a data-driven culture—allowing everyone to analyze policies, contribute meaningful insights, and hold institutions accountable more effectively.
