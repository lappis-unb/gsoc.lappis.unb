Empurrando Juntas (EJ) is a powerful tool for social participation, designed to collect opinions and facilitate collaboration. By integrating EJ with Decidim, we can harness the collective power of multiple communities, enabling more inclusive and impactful decision-making processes.

Decidim provides a robust framework for citizen participation, offering features for public consultations, deliberative processes, and collaborative decision-making. By integrating EJ with Decidim, we can enhance the platform's capabilities, making it easier for participants to engage and contribute.

One key benefit of integrating EJ with Decidim is the ability to leverage EJ's artificial intelligence techniques for grouping participants based on their opinions. This can help streamline the decision-making process, enabling more efficient and effective collaboration.

Another advantage is the potential to expand the reach of both tools. By integrating EJ with Decidim, we can bring EJ's powerful participation features to Decidim's existing user base, and vice versa. This can help foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among different communities, leading to more diverse and inclusive outcomes.
