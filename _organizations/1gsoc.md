Google Summer of Code  (GSoC) is a worldwide online program aimed at attracting new contributors to open-source software development. Participants in Google Summer of Code are matched with mentors from open-source organizations, providing them with valuable insights into real-world software development practices. By working on real projects, contributors have the opportunity to learn from seasoned open-source developers. Additionally, participants receive a small stipend as an incentive.


LAPPIS was proud to be one of the 195 mentoring organizations for GSoC 2024â€”and one of only 30 organizations participating for the first time. We mentored four amazing newcomers, and the experience brought fresh perspectives to our local community while deepening our understanding of the platform.

Participating in GSoC allowed us to connect with students from around the world. It was more than just a technical exchange; it was also a social and cultural opportunity that broadened the professional horizons of both mentors and participants. Our organization learned a great deal from this experience, and we look forward to participating in GSoC again in the future.
