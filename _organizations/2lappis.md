Located in the University of Brasilia (UnB) Led by women, the lab's mission is to increase the number of young South Americans, women and underrepresented groups in contribute to high-impact open-source projects.

We do this through collaboration with both government and private sector in developing open source projects. We had more than 100 students with scholarship contributing to OSS in Brazilian context. LAPPIS also engage in discussions advocating for open standards, participating in policy discussions and development, and raising awareness about the benefits of open-source development and adoption, while fomenting local industry.
