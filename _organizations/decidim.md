Decidim, derived from the Catalan phrase meaning “let’s decide” or “we decide,” is a digital infrastructure designed for participatory democracy. Built entirely as free software, Decidim is a Ruby on Rails–based framework that anyone can use to create and customize a web platform for democratic engagement.

With robust features and a user-friendly interface, Decidim fosters a more participatory and inclusive democratic process. In Brazil, the Brasil Participativo platform leverages Decidim to empower individuals to create profiles, share ideas, and directly influence the policies that affect their lives.

We actively contribute to the Decidim community and ecosystem by adopting and enhancing various community-developed plugins, further promoting open-source collaboration and innovation.
