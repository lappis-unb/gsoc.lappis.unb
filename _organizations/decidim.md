Decidim, derived from the Catalan phrase "let's decide" or "we decide," is a digital infrastructure designed for participatory democracy. It serves as a digital platform built entirely and collaboratively as free software. Specifically, Decidim is a web environment, or framework, developed in Ruby on Rails, a programming language. This framework enables anyone to create and configure a web platform to function as a political network for democratic participation.

With its robust features and user-friendly interface, Decidim serves as a powerful tool for fostering a more participatory and inclusive democratic process. Moving forward, the Brazil Participativo platform, powered by Decidim, stands as a symbol of digital empowerment, encouraging individuals to create profiles and actively participate in shaping policies that impact their lives.
